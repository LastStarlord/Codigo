Management System (BMS) Framework
The BMS architecture is shown below:
Figure 2: BMS Architecture
The battery system’s protection and monitoring functions are implemented through a three-tier
Battery Management System (BMS) architecture, consisting of the pack-level BMU, the rack- level
BCMU, and the system-level BAMS. The primary functions of each BMS layer are as follows:
BMU (Pack Level – Integrated within the Battery Pack): Monitors the voltage and temperature of
individual cells, as well as the total voltage of the battery pack. The BMU transmits this information
in real time to the higher-level BMS via the CAN protocol. It also manages voltage balancing
between individual cells to ensure consistent performance.
BCMU (Rack Level – Installed in the High Voltage Box): Monitors the total voltage and current
of the entire battery rack, transmitting real-time data to the upper-level BMS via the CAN
protocol. It provides key indicators such as the battery’s State of Charge (SOC), State of Health
(SOH), power prediction, and internal resistance. The BCMU also manages relay control and
voltage balancing at the rack level.
EMU (System Level – Applied in Multi-Rack Configurations; Installed in the AC confluence
cabinet): Collects data from multiple BCMUs and performs real-time estimation of the system’s
remaining capacity and health. It communicates with the host controller and external systems
via RS-485, CAN, and Modbus-TCP/IP. Depending on the system's complexity, the BAMS can
be integrated within the high voltage box or installed as a standalone unit.
Battery Management System Features
Analog Measurement: The BMS continuously monitors key parameters such as rack voltage,
charge and discharge current, ambient temperature, individual cell voltage, and cell temperature.
It also performs real-time calculations of the State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH)
10
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY
=== PAGINA 13 ===
for individual cells, ensuring safe, stable, and reliable operation of the battery system while
extending service life.
Balancing: The BMS includes cell balancing functionality to maintain consistent voltage levels
across cells. This helps to maximize usable capacity and prolong the overall life of the battery
system.
Operational Alarm Function: When abnormalities such as overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent,
high/low temperature, communication failure, or internal BMS faults are detected, the system
triggers alarm signals. These alarms are reported to the PCS and the central monitoring system,
enabling timely intervention and adjustment of operating strategies.
System Protection: If measured values (voltage, current, temperature, etc.) exceed safety
thresholds during operation, the BMS isolates the affected rack and takes it offline to prevent
system-wide impact. Protection events are simultaneously reported to the upper-level control
system.
Self-Diagnosis: The BMS performs ongoing self-checks to detect issues such as communication
interruptions with external systems, internal data bus errors, and sensor acquisition anomalies.
Using diagnostic models, the system analyzes charge/discharge current, temperature, cell
terminal voltage, internal resistance, and other parameters to assess SOC, SOH, and real-time
discharge availability. All diagnostic results can be reported to the monitoring system.
Thermal Management: Lithium battery modules generate heat during charging, raising internal
temperatures. The BMS monitors temperature in real time and activates thermal control
equipment when preset thresholds are exceeded. If temperatures reach critical levels, the BMS
can automatically shut down the affected battery pack to prevent thermal runaway.
Local Status Display and Data Logging: The BMS provides local display of system operating
status, including real-time analog data, alarms, and protection events. Historical data such as
configuration changes, alarm records, protection actions, and charge/discharge timestamps are
logged with power-off retention capability. Alarm logs include threshold values, triggered
parameters, timestamps, and peak readings during alarm periods.
Operation Authority Management: The system supports role-based access control through
password-protected operation rights. Any modification to operational modes or parameters
requires authorization to ensure security and traceability

Fire Fighting System (FFS) Description (UL Certified)
The fire protection design of the energy storage system emphasizes fire suppression rather than
explosion prevention. It utilizes a multi-tiered fire suppression strategy, combining battery pack-
level immersion protection, aerosol fire extinguishing systems, traditional sprinkler systems, and
deflagration panels for pressure relief. The system components include early warning devices,
automatic fire extinguishing units, exhaust systems, and sprinkler systems.
The fire safety strategy includes the following key elements:
• Each battery module is equipped with cell-level temperature sensors, enabling early
warning capabilities through real-time monitoring and BMS linkage management.
• If the battery pack temperature becomes excessively high, two or more cells exceed the
over-temperature threshold of approximately 80°C, and the overall pack temperature rise
rate surpasses 24°C within 9 seconds (detected every 3 seconds and sustained for 3 or
more consecutive times), the battery pack's immersion fire suppression system is
activated, initiating liquid injection to mitigate the early stage of thermal runaway.
• Each protected area is equipped with dual independent detection circuits, featuring smoke
and temperature detectors with dry contact outputs. Upon simultaneous activation of both
detectors, the system issues a fire alarm to the main control system located in the high
voltage box, immediately halts all charging and discharging activities, sends a dry contact
shutdown signal to the PCS, and disconnects the rack contactors after a one-second
delay. If the local temperature reaches the aerosol fire extinguishing device’s activation
point, the extinguishing agent is deployed, and a confirmation signal is sent to the BMS.
• The cabinet includes a pre-installed DN25 external threaded pipe capped at the outdoor
cabinet’s exterior wall. During site installation, the cap is removed, and the pipe is
extended to connect to an external firefighting valve. Upon valve activation, water flows
through the piping network to closed-head sprinkler nozzles. The sprinklers, equipped with
heat-sensitive elements, automatically activate in the presence of fire or high- temperature
airflow, rupturing to discharge water for fire suppression.
Aerosol Fire Extinguishing Systems
The cabinet-level fire protection solution in this design utilizes an aerosol-based automatic fire
extinguishing system. The fire control panel and sound and light alarm devices are not pre-
installed; they will be provided and installed on-site according to customer requirements. These
components can be installed either inside or externally on the AC confluence cabinet.
Communication between the fire control unit and the energy storage system can be integrated
into the BMS network or configured to operate independently. Each energy storage station cabinet
is equipped with dedicated pressure relief ports to safely discharge excess air pressure and
aerosol extinguishing agents during fire suppression activation.

System working mode
1. Alarm and Delayed Activation
To ensure personnel safety before the aerosol fire extinguishing system is activated, the system
is configured with a delay mechanism.
When a fire alarm signal is detected, the system immediately triggers the in-station and off- station
sound and light alarms. After a 30-second delay, if no emergency stop is triggered, the aerosol
fire extinguisher is activated.
2. Automatic manual mode
The fire suppression system supports two operational modes: Automatic Mode and Manual Mode,
switchable via the "Automatic/Manual" selector.
• Automatic Mode: When a fire alarm is detected, the system automatically triggers the
alarms and activates the aerosol fire extinguisher after the delay period.
• Manual Mode: In Manual Mode, upon fire detection, the system only triggers the sound
and light alarms. The fire extinguisher will not activate automatically; manual intervention
is required if necessary.
Operators should select Manual Mode during personnel presence inside the station and return to
Automatic Mode after personnel exit.
3. Forced Start and Emergency Stop
Forced Start: In either Automatic or Manual Mode, pressing the Forced Start button immediately
triggers the in-station and off-station sound and light alarms. After a 30-second delay, the aerosol
fire extinguisher is activated.
Emergency Stop: Pressing the Emergency Stop button during the delay cancels the fire
extinguishing sequence and silences all alarms. In addition, the system will execute protective
13
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY
=== PAGINA 16 ===
actions: delaying 2 seconds to disconnect each rack contactor, issuing PCS shutdown
commands, and isolating the affected systems according to emergency protocols.
System Functions
1. Sound and Light Alarms
The system provides early warning and fire alarm functions via acousto-optic signaling. Fire
alarms are issued through in-station and off-station sound and light alarm devicesSound and light
alarm (on-site installation as per customer requirements).
2. Intelligent Fire Detection and Judgment
The system utilizes integrated detectors combining smoke, temperature, and gas sensors to
perform intelligent fire detection. Fire risk assessments are conducted using methods such as
fixed thresholds, multi-sensor data fusion, and trend analysis. When a high-sensitivity gas sensor
detects an abnormal concentration of thermal runaway gases, or a smoke sensor detects visible
smoke, or multiple sensors collectively indicate abnormal conditions, an early warning is triggered.
If, following the early warning, the temperature sensor detects an abnormal temperature trend
with a clear upward trajectory, the system escalates the status to a fire warning.
3. Delayed Activation Sequence
The system is equipped with a strict activation sequence that ensures sufficient time for
evacuation before activating the aerosol fire suppression system. Upon fire detection, sound and
light alarms are triggered immediately, followed by a delay to provide station personnel adequate
time to evacuate safely before fire suppression actions commence.
4. Integrated Detector
Each detector integrates smoke detection and temperature monitoring. Utilizing a "power battery
thermal runaway model," the system analyzes real-time thermal parameters to assess potential
thermal runaway events or fire conditions. Detectors are installed at the top section of each battery
cabinet space for optimal monitoring coverage.

Cabinet Safety Features
Heat Insulation and Dust Protection
The cabinet’s main external structure is fabricated from weathering steel plates, hot-rolled steel, and
other materials commonly used in shipping containers. The surface is coated with a zinc-rich primer,
an intermediate epoxy layer, and an acrylic topcoat. The anti-corrosion coating thickness reaches
150μm, ensuring durability in harsh cold climate conditions.
Inside the cabinet, 50 mm high-density sandwich rock wool panels are installed, providing excellent
thermal insulation to maintain optimal battery operation.
Considering the impact of wind and sand in the deployment regions, cabinet doors, vents, and fans
are fitted with tightly sealed structures and dust filters, effectively preventing sand and dust from
entering the cabinet.
Moisture and Waterproof Protection
The battery pack is a high-voltage energy storage unit containing numerous control circuits and single
cells. Ingress of liquids could cause short circuits, leakage, or corrosion of the cells, circuits, and
connectors, posing significant safety risks.
15
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY
=== PAGINA 18 ===
It is essential to ensure that the battery pack is protected against water immersion, rain exposure, and
high humidity. Immediate maintenance is required if any part of the battery pack is exposed to rain or
submerged in liquid.
Considering the heavy rainfall and significant day-night temperature differences at the project site, all
cabinet doors are equipped with high-performance rubber seals to prevent water ingress and moisture
intrusion.
This design ensures both waterproofing and thermal insulation, minimizing the risk of condensation
inside the cabinet.
UV Protection
Ultraviolet absorbers are added to the coatings on all steel plates covering the cabinet's exterior
surfaces. This treatment prevents material degradation caused by UV exposure and reduces the
absorption of UV-induced heat.
High-Voltage Insulation
All power connection points within the battery pack are protected by sufficient insulation measures,
ensuring that neither the positive nor the negative terminals come into contact with the external
housing under any circumstances, thereby preventing leakage or short-circuit hazards.
Maintenance pathways inside the cabinet are additionally covered with insulating rubber mats to
enhance operational safety.
Cooling and Insulation System
The cabinet interior adopts a thermal insulation design to provide superior temperature control.
Each system has undergone comprehensive thermal flow simulation by a specialized team to optimize
heat management.
A large air intake area combined with an ample air exhaust outlet forms an effective cooling system,
ensuring efficient heat dissipation and maintaining system performance even under high- temperature
conditions.

Global Manufacturing
Gotion builds close to where the future unfolds. With over 20 gigafactories worldwide—from
Asia and Europe to North America — our global manufacturing network is designed for scale,
flexibility, and proximity to our customers.
Our manufacturing footprint supports the full battery value chain, from cell and pack production
to containerized ESS assembly, with facilities purpose-built to meet rising demand in electric
mobility and energy storage.
U.S. Manufacturing
In the United States, we’re proud to lead with our Manteno, Illinois production facility—a
cornerstone of our North American strategy. This state-of-the-art plant supports containerized
ESS assembly, functional testing, and quality control for utility-scale deployments. Located just
outside Chicago, Manteno is strategically positioned to serve partners across the U.S. with
shorter lead times and local compliance confidence. Opened in September 2023, this facility is
one of the most ambitious battery manufacturing investments in the U.S. energy transition.
The first container rolled off the line in Q1 2024, marking the start of localized ESS supply from
Illinois. With integrated lines for cell, pack, and system assembly, Manteno will play a central
role in supporting Gotion’s North American ESS customers—delivering on performance,
logistics, and domestic content strategy.
